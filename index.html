</p><h3>4. Minting and Burning Mechanism</h3><p>To maintain the stability of TIME tokens, the Wonderland protocol employs a minting and burning mechanism. When the price of TIME falls below the value of the treasury assets, the protocol buys back and burns TIME tokens, reducing the token supply and increasing the value of the remaining tokens. This mechanism helps to maintain the peg between TIME tokens and the treasury assets.</p><h3>5. Staking and Rewds</h3><p>One of the key features of Aerodrome Finance is the ability for users to stake their TIME tokens and earn rewards. Stakers can earn attractive rewards through the protocol's high Annual Percentage Yield (APY). The rewards are funded by minting new TIME tokens, which are distributed to stakers based on their stake in the protocol. This incentivizes users to hold and stake their TIME tokens, contributing to the stability and growth of the protocol.</p><h3>6. Minting and Treasury Contributi</h3><p>In addition to staking, users can also participate in minting TIME tokens. Minting involves selling certain assets, such as TIME-MIM liquidity pooland wrapped AVAX, to the Wonderland protocol. Minters receive newly minted TIME tokens at a discounted price, contributing to the protocol's treasury balance. The growing treasury balance allows Wonderland to increase the backing per TIME token and sustain high reward APYs for stakers.</p><h3>7. Governance and Participation</h3><p>Aerodrome Finance holders also have the opportunity to participate in the governance of the protocol. Through their TIME tokens, holders can vote on protocol proposals and have a say in the future direction of the project. This democratic governance model ensures that the community has a voice in decision-making and fosters a sense of ownership among token holders.</p><h3>8. Future Prospects</h3><p>Aerodrome Finance has already achieved signifiIn conclusion, Aerodrome Finance (TIME) is a native token that powers the Wonderland protocol, a decentralized reserve currency system on the Avalanche network. It offers stability, attractive rewards for stakers, and opportunities for governance participation. With its growing treasury and strong community support, Aerodrome Finance has the potential for further growth and development in the future.
